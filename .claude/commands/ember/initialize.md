# Initialize Ember Framework

Initialize the Ember project management framework through an adaptive, interactive process.

## Create a TODO with EXACTLY these items

1. Scan and analyze the project
2. Interactive confirmation with user
3. Check for existing Ember documents
4. Guide document creation process
5. Create first milestone for Ember
6. Generate project manifest
7. Provide next steps

## DETAILS on every TODO item

### 1. Scan and analyze the project

**Detect project characteristics:**

- Check for package.json, requirements.txt, composer.json, etc. Identify the project type based on the root directory.
- Scan overall project structure
- Identify if project is a monorepo or not. This is important for scanning the project.
- Look for existing documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/, etc.)

**Keep findings brief** - Just identify the essentials

### 2. Interactive confirmation with user

**Present findings conversationally:**

```
I found this to be a [project type] project named [detected name].
Is this correct? Should I proceed with Ember setup?
```

**Get user confirmation before continuing**

### 3. Build the project structure

**Interactive decision:**

- "No Ember documents found yet. Do you have any existing project documentation you'd like to copy in before we continue?"

**Allow user to:**

- Use existing documents
- Add new documents
- Start fresh
- Cancel to add documents manually first

### 4. Guide document creation process

**Based on user's choice:**

**If starting fresh or extending:**

- Perform deep analysis of the codebase
- Identify key components and architecture patterns
- Create draft ARCHITECTURE.md based on analysis
- Use Q&A style to refine and complete:
  - "What's the main purpose of this project?"
  - "What are the key technical decisions?"
  - "Any important constraints or requirements?"

**If using existing docs:**

- Import and adapt existing documentation
- Fill in any Ember-specific sections
- Ensure compatibility with framework structure

**Keep it conversational and adaptive**

### 5. Create first milestone for Ember

**Determine appropriate first milestone:**

- If new project: Start with setup/foundation milestone
- If existing project: Ask user what they want to focus on.

**Interactive milestone creation:**

- "Based on the project state, I suggest creating milestone: [name]"
- "What would you like to focus on in this milestone?"
- Create milestone structure with initial requirements
- Keep scope realistic and focused

### 6. Generate project manifest

**Automatically generate manifest using:**

- Information gathered during setup
- Created/imported documentation
- Current milestone details
- Project metadata
- Use the `.ember/99_TEMPLATES/project_manifest_template.md` as a guide to create the manifest file.

**No user interaction needed** - Just inform when complete

### 7. Provide next steps

**Customized guidance based on setup:**

```
âœ… Ember initialized for [project name]!

Current setup:
- Project type: [type]
- Current milestone: [milestone]
- Documents: [created/imported]

Next steps:
- Review your architecture: 01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Check milestone requirements: 02_REQUIREMENTS/[milestone]/
- Start first task: /project:ember:create_general_task

Ready to begin development!
```

## ADAPTIVE PROCESS NOTES

- **Stay conversational** - Ask questions naturally, not like a form
- **Be smart** - Use MCP's or tool calling to understand context and make intelligent suggestions
- **Allow flexibility** - User can skip, cancel, or modify at any point
- **Focus on value** - Only create what's useful for the specific project
- **Keep it simple** - Don't overwhelm with options or details
